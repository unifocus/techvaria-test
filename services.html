             <h4>Business &amp; Data Analytics</h4>
             <p>In a nutshell, Business Intelligence (also simply addressed as BI) refers to a set of applications and processes that help analyses a company’s data, activities, projects, scope and revenue. Several aspects fall under the category of Business Intelligence. These are:</p>
            <p><strong>Strategy and planning : </strong> These days’ businesses are by and large driven by data. After all, data helps companies take informed decisions that have a definitive source and cause. Techvaria provides complete strategizing and planning services to help you understand techniques on how you can better utilize your data. This can assist you in monetizing your data, understand issues within your network, acquire better resources and plan your corporate finance better.</p>
            <p><strong>Performance Management : </strong>Techvaria possesses the expertise to help you maximize your data output to supervise business performance. This can include the company itself, its divisions, projects, or its personnel. Our Performance Management consulting can help automate the discovery of such aspects.</p>
            <p><strong>Big Data : </strong>Big Data is easily understood as those data types that are large in quantity, rate at which it changes, or its type. To handle big data, you need an experienced eye that can not only metaphorically ‘digest’ big data, but also present you with accurate awareness, a decisive approach and process automation. Techvaria provides the answer.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Visualization : </strong>For data to have a semblance of usable output and success, it needs to be presentable and understood. The visual medium is the most intuitive and meaningful in this regard. Techvaria provides key data visualization solutions that enables you to access your data and analytics through customizable dashboards, filters, parameters, graphs and more.</p><br>
            <p><strong>1.	Analytical Solutions : </strong>(systems, applications, products) has made business processes simpler thanks to big data and analytics. Things from material to inventory, planning to delivery, and data to transactions have all been made possible thanks to robust  implementations. However, there are incumbent chasms that exist that have the potential to affect a project’s eventual goal. Techvaria provides key business solutions in  to address all such issues and help your projects witness successful deployment and enable business growth in the process.</p>
            <p><strong>2.	Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) : </strong>Revenue, profit and financial management are some of the key aspects of a CFO’s (Chief Financial Officer) core result areas. Also, known as corporate performance management, EPM solutions give them better control over planning and strategy, which enables them to mobilise reports and enhance profit. EPM helps you obtain a better reporting structure, flexible and agile organisational structure, quicker planning, financial consolidation, and budgeting and forecasting. Higher revenue and better financial planning and management are additional benefits of this solution.</p>
            <p><strong>3.	Business Intelligence : </strong>One of the most vital giveaways that business intelligence (or BI for the practiced hand) has is that it gives those who apply it, the power to visualise. Visualization also leads to be able to weave a narrative across a project. Interactive dashboards give one the opportunity to access data assuming multiple roles and obtain reports and analytics accordingly.</p>
            <p><strong>4.	 Business Objects Predictive Data Analytics : </strong>As the name suggests, this analysis helps business take an informed decision about their projects and processes. Building predictive models and model management, apart from data, scoring and link analysis also comprise this aspect of analytical solutions. Our Business Objects implementation is typically a data mining solution that help you detect hidden insights in data that drive predictions and decisions. Our  Business Objects solution creates a mélange of  Infinite Sight and  Predictive Analysis into a single installation.</p>
            <p><strong>5.	 HANA : </strong>HANA (also known as S/4 HANA) is a database management system with its key function being to store and retrieve data as willed by application. The solution that we provide our clientele in  HANA keeps digitization uppermost among its goals and assists the process. This application scores high on the user experience (US) front due to integrating  Fiori and we can deploy this either as a desktop or cloud-server based solution. One of the most outstanding features of  HANA is its built-in memory that enables users to access large volumes of data on a real-time basis. </p>
            <p><strong>7.	 Digital Boardroom : </strong>Digital Boardroom is a solution that is built to involve  HANA and its cloud instance. As the name indicates, this is a truly digital solution that helps companies emerge as one that has adapted with and adopted a digital outlook. Our solution enables clients using this solution to take data and report driven decisions.</p>

            <p><strong>Our Managed Services solutions </strong><br>&ndash;	are a great way to stay concurrent with technology trends, enhance infrastructure and business practices and address several incumbent aspects of technology and business.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages : </strong><br><strong>&ndash;	Cost-control :</strong>Outsourcing your managed services requirements will ease the trouble of infrastructure, workforce, hiring, training. Management, planning and welfare at your end. </p>
            <p><strong>&ndash;	Retain focal point : </strong>Having multiple departments and divisions can be taxing from a management point of view. Often, this can tell on your business and people-management can adversely affect where you need to keep your focus on. With our managed services solutions, we take care of ‘your requirements’ while you keep your focus intact.</p>
            <p><strong>&ndash;	Get an expert : </strong>Having handed the responsibility of taking care of your managed services requisites to Techvaria, you get an expert looking into its functioning, operation and success. </p>
            <p><strong>&ndash;	Remains independent of company structure : </strong>Often &ndash; as is seen in the case of several companies - businesses need to restructure due to funding, expansion and market plans. This results in personnel being shifted, responsibilities being acquired and more. However, by outsourcing your managed services requirements to Techvaria, they remain independent of any activity within your company. These will function seamlessly.</p>
            <p><strong>&ndash;	Adapt with trends, without having to adapt : </strong>The ever-changing nature of the market and technology trends can be quite unsettling. Thus, acquiring new resources, software, infrastructure and more can be extremely time consuming and counterproductive. Instead, leave it to the specialists at Techvaria. Your managed services will always be in synchronization with market trends.</p>
